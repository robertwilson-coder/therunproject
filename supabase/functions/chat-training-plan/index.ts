- When the user refers to "today" or "what's my next workout", they are asking about ${currentDayName} in Week ${currentTrainingWeek}
- When the user refers to "tomorrow", they mean ${tomorrowDayName} (${tomorrowDate})
- When the user refers to days of the week (like "Monday", "Thursday", etc.) without specifying a week, they mean the current week (Week ${currentTrainingWeek})
- The plan structure uses "Week X" with day names (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun)
- Look up the workout for ${currentDayName} in Week ${currentTrainingWeek} when they ask about "today's workout"

      completedContext = `

COMPLETED WORKOUTS:
The following workouts have been marked as COMPLETED by the user:
${completedList}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR IDENTIFYING "NEXT WORKOUT":

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
- "Next workout" = next scheduled item (could be rest, recovery walk, or actual run)
- "Next run" = next actual running session (skip rest days and non-running activities)
- "Next training session" = next actual training activity (skip pure rest days)

When the user mentions "next workout", "next run", or "move my next X to Y":
1. Look at today's date from DATE CONTEXT: ${todaysDate}
2. If they say "next RUN" or "next training", skip rest days and find the first RUNNING workout from today forward
3. If they say "next workout" (generic), include everything (rest, recovery, runs)
4. NEVER select workouts from days that have already passed
5. The search order must be: today (if uncompleted) → tomorrow → day after → etc.
6. Check the completed workouts list above to know what's been done
7. Example: If today is Thursday (completed) and they ask for "next run":
   - Friday = Rest (SKIP)
   - Saturday = Active Recovery walk (SKIP if they said "run")
   - Sunday = 6km run (THIS IS THE NEXT RUN)

CRITICAL: "Next" always means forward in time from today, never backwards to previous days!

2. INFORMATIONAL QUESTIONS - When user asks "what do I have for the rest of the week" or similar informational questions:
   - DO NOT list out the workouts for them
   - Instead, redirect them to check their plan: "Please refer back to your plan above to see your upcoming workouts. If you'd like to make any adjustments, just let me know!"
   - DO NOT return an updatedPlan (set it to null)
   - Keep it brief and encouraging
   - ALWAYS return updatedPlan as null for this type of question

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- Workout keys use format "week-DayName" (e.g., "1-Thu" means Week 1 Thursday)
- Days of the week order: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
- When user asks to move workout "to tomorrow", USE THE EXACT DAY NAME from the DATE CONTEXT above where it says "Tomorrow is: [DAY]"
- CRITICAL: "Tomorrow" is explicitly calculated above - DO NOT calculate it yourself, just use the day name provided
- Always think chronologically forward from today's date
