# Fix TypeScript errors systematically

# Fix unused imports in various files
echo "Fixing unused imports and variables..."

# The errors are mostly unused imports (TS6133) and a few other issues
# Let me list all the fixes needed based on the TypeScript errors

# The main issues are:
# 1. Unused imports - can be safely removed or ignored for now
# 2. Function signature mismatches - need to be fixed
# 3. Possibly undefined values - need optional chaining or checks
